# Neural Pattern Training

## Purpose
Continuously improve coordination through neural network learning with SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture).

## Pattern Persistence

Patterns are **automatically persisted** to disk:
- **Patterns**: `.claude-flow/neural/patterns.json`
- **Stats**: `.claude-flow/neural/stats.json`

Patterns survive process restarts and are loaded automatically on next session.

## How Training Works

### 1. Automatic Learning
Every successful operation trains the neural networks:
- Edit patterns for different file types
- Search strategies that find results faster
- Task decomposition approaches
- Agent coordination patterns

### 2. Manual Training
```bash
# Train coordination patterns (50 epochs)
npx claude-flow neural train -p coordination -e 50

# Train optimization patterns with custom learning rate
npx claude-flow neural train -p optimization -l 0.005

# Quick training (10 epochs)
npx claude-flow neural train -e 10
```

### 3. Pattern Types

**Training Pattern Types:**
- `coordination` - Task coordination strategies (default)
- `optimization` - Performance optimization patterns
- `prediction` - Predictive preloading patterns

**Cognitive Patterns:**
- Convergent: Focused problem-solving
- Divergent: Creative exploration
- Lateral: Alternative approaches
- Systems: Holistic thinking
- Critical: Analytical evaluation
- Abstract: High-level design

### 4. Improvement Tracking
```bash
# Check neural system status
npx claude-flow neural status
```

## Pattern Management

```bash
# List all persisted patterns
npx claude-flow neural patterns --action list

# Search patterns by query
npx claude-flow neural patterns --action list -q "error handling"

# Analyze patterns
npx claude-flow neural patterns --action analyze -q "coordination"
```

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| SONA Adaptation | sub-ms (achieved: ~2μs) |
| Pattern Search | O(log n) with HNSW |
| Memory Efficient | Circular buffers |

## Benefits
- 🧠 Learns your coding style
- 📈 Improves with each use
- 🎯 Better task predictions
- ⚡ Faster coordination
- 💾 Patterns persist across sessions
